<h1>Titre du texte</h1>
<p>Erdoğan also lashed out at foreign media for leading black propaganda against Turkey in the fight against the Daesh terrorist organization, stating that Turkey was one of the countries who led the fiercest fight against all kinds of terror.</p>
<h2>sous-titre</h2>
<p>We are American, and our team has more than 30 members, including Ukrainian-American, Iraqi-American, and quite a few other varieties of folks.</p>
<p>We are completely independent, because we not funded by anyone, and we have no formal institutional affiliations. We are nonpartisan, in that our team includes all major political persuasions except the pro-Russian kind. We are anonymous for now, because we are civilian Davids taking on a state-backed adversary Goliath, and we take things like the international Russian intimidation of journalists, “Pizzagate”-style mob harassment, and the assassination of Jo Cox very seriously, but we can in some cases provide background information about ourselves on a confidential basis to professional journalists.</p>
