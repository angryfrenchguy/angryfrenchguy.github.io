<p>CAMEROON :: Political Party: A d s SDF could sign an English p Posted :: CAMEROON?<br />
To denounce the resurgence of violence against lawyers and peaceful demonstrators and to dissociate from their counterparts in the CPDM who met with a handful of English-speaking lawyers in the context of the shower assault perpetrated against Anglophone lawyers the Northwest regions of the Southwest and demand the return of federalism.<br />
Peacefully to demand the translation of the uniform act Ohada in English, create an English bar in Cameroon are among other mobile strike Anglophone lawyers severely repressed by law enforcement forces. They were followed in this chorus of claims by English teacher walkout from Monday, November 21, 2016 in Bamenda. In solidarity with the teachers, the people raging came out in droves to denounce the evils which are theirs daily and call for the resignation of the president and his government.<br />
These mood swings that led to bloody clashes between unarmed demonstrators and the defense forces, heavily armed, have plunged the city of Bamenda in a popular uprising that the regime did not see coming. Already, to try to defuse social bomb, a meeting took place on Tuesday 15 November in the hotel deputies between the Anglophone CPDM MPs and representatives of English-speaking lawyers from the Southwest and Northwest.<br />
Several resolutions were adopted namely among others, the condemnation of barbarism perpetrated on lawyers, bullied by elements of the security forces, the establishment of an independent parliamentary inquiry to clarify the circumstances of violence on lawyers in the English-speaking areas, compensation for victims and others. Coming out of this conclave, the SDF anglophone members also met to sign a petition that seeks to dissociate themselves from the initiative of their counterparts CPDM who wanted to minimize acts of savagery carried out against men and women in black dress.<br />
For the English-speaking elected SDF, the judicial subsystem says common law and under Anglo-Saxon education system are the last vestiges of Anglophone Cameroon inherited that contribute to the country's unity, national integration. For SDF, the two subsystems are to be restored and implemented in the North-west and South-west with a view to maintain the bi-culturalism Cameroon.<br />
Finally, the petitioners demand the government of Paul Biya, arrest and court translation elements of the security forces, perpetrators of violence against lawyers and sanction administrative authorities involved.<br />
At the finish, the SDF anglophone members are convinced that the return to federalism as practiced in Cameroon in 1961, is the only way to bring the country conflicts that inflame the country and allow Anglophone and Francophone entities to better promote their cultural identity.</p>
